  Python is a popular dynamic programming language that has thrived in the past decade with massive applications in various deciplines. Python frameworks evolve to resist the tendency to progressively grow useless with time. In the evolution of Python frameworks, compatibility issues comes with the increasing complication of framework release versions. We investigated the compound change patterns occurred in Python framework evolution and built a tool to automatically detect such changes using a tree-differencing algorithm. \textit{Experiments on real-world projects show the capabilities of our tool.}
