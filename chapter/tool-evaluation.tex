\chapter{Tool Evaluation}
\label{chap:tool-evaluation}

In this section, I want to access the effectiveness of my tool on real-world data. I took advantage of the commit histories in the previous empirical study on Python framework evolution. For 50 commits of typical changes, including method renaming, parameter changes, parameter default value changes, and return annotation changes, among frameworks TensorFlow, Django, and Pandas, \textit{ccdetector} was able to correctly detect all the occurred changes and classify them in line with the intentions documented in the commit messages.
