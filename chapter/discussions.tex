\section{The \textit{*args} and \textit{**kwargs} Parameters}

Besides \textit{* (bare asterisk)}, other special parameters in Python functions include \textit{*args} and \textit{**kwargs}, both enabling programmers to pass a variable number of arguments to a function, whose content cannot be retrieved by merely looking at the function signature. The former allows passing a list of parameters, possibly of different types, into the function. The latter contains a dictionary of parameters.

Modifications related to the two variable-quantity-parameter symbols are extra tricky to deal with, as the contents of those two parameters would only be unmasked by comprehending the actual implementation in the function body. If the framework API developer decided to insert or remove variables inside \textit{*args} or \textit{**kwargs}, or change the type of internal variables, we could only know until they take effects.  As previously explained, the analysis in this project is completely based on the edit scripts generated by GumTree. And currently, the inspection stays at the function signature level, not digging into detailed implementation. In addition, type analysis is also tremendously helpful but difficult and yet to be carried out. Based on the above reasons, ccdetector leaves the analysis of \textit{*args} and \textit{**kwargs} to future endeavors.

\section{\textit{Boolean} Values}

As one of Python's built-in types, booleans are subtypes of integers. The obstacle of analyzing it lies in that its node is found missing at the location of a boolean value in the AST produced by GumTree's parser. Due to this unexpected behavior, \textit{ccdetector} is currently not able to detection boolean-value-related modifications.

\section{Cross-file Function Relocation}

Due to the limitation that the evolution of only one Python source file is analyzed at a time, function relocations from the original file to others are not detected.
