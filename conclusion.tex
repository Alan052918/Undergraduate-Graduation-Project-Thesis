In this project, my initial goal is to automate the construction of the framework evolution knowledge base in Zhaoxu and Hengcheng's work~\cite{DBLP:conf/wcre/ZhangZWTLX20}. In order to do that, I need to make a tool that automatically detects high-level changes in evolved python source files. First, I conducted an empirical study of commit histories of real-world Python frameworks to understand the high-level changes in Python framework API evolution. I collected 535 commits in three popular Python libraries that represented typical compound change patterns. Based on my empirical findings, and with the help of the tree-differencing tool GumTree~\cite{DBLP:conf/kbse/FalleriMBMM14}, I designed and implemented a tool \textit{ccdetector} that can automatically detect 14 types of high-level changes in python source files. In the evaluation phase of ccdetector, it successfully detected all the occurred changes in 50 real-world commits selected from three popular Python frameworks and classify them into the same categories as the intentions recorded in the commit messages.
