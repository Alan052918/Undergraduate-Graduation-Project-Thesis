\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

In this thesis, we conducted an empirical study of commit histories of real-world Python frameworks to understand the high-level compound changes in Python framework API evolution. We collected 535 commits that represented typical compound change patterns in three popular Python libraries. Based on our empirical findings, we designed and implemented a tool that can automatically detect compatibility issues in client programs caused by compound breaking changes in dependent Python frameworks. \textit{And will evaluate it on real-world projects to measure its capability.}
